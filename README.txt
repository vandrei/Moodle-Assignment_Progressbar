Block created by Andrei Vasilescu

This block shows students the time elapsed since a due assignment has started.

When the time elapsed is between  1 - 50% the progressbar is green.
When the time elapsed is between 51 - 80% the progressbar is yellow.
When the time elapsed is greater than 80%  the progressbar becomes red.

The block can be displayed on all pages and it shows only the active assignments
for the current student.

I used Twitter Bootstrap css for the progressbars.

Enjoy!
