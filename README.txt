Block created by Andrei Vasilescu

This block shows students the time elapsed since a due assignment has started.

The site administrator can set 3 colors for the progressbar, depending on the time elapsed.

Initial values are: 
    1-50% green progressbar
    51-80% yellow progressbar
    81-100% red progressbar

The block can be displayed on all pages and it shows only the active assignments
for the current student.

I used Twitter Bootstrap css for the progressbars.

Enjoy!
